## Steps to Run the code:

1. Clone this github repository using "git clone <name of the repo>".

2. After cloning, get inside the main folder of the code repository.

3. There are different files for each component (python files are named accordingly). With running these files using the command "python <filename.py>", one can see the output of the desired component.

4. We also have one python file named "sql_connect.py" which will be used to connect the SQL database and add all the activities inside the database with their necessary columns.
