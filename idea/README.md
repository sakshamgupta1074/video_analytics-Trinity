# Idea Submission for Video Analytics - by Team Trinity

## Problem Being Solved

Surveillance is being constantly carried out via Video Cameras at Branches, ATMs & Offices of the Bank. As a proactive measure and to protect against unscrupulous elements, the video feed is constantly monitored by personnel at Command Centres / Control rooms.

1. The solution should be able to constantly scan multiple video footage for Suspicious Activities, breaks/Interruptions in the footage, or any activity that needs attention.

2. The solution should be able to count the number of people and calculate the time taken for activity on the premises and Identify known facilitators.

3. It should be in the Communication with Control / Command Centres / Vendors and have a Feedback mechanism for false positives / incorrect classification for enhancement in the model.


## Approach taken to create the model

***Third Eye*** â€“ An advanced AI solution capable of identifying various suspicious activities happening on bank premises, through CCTV footage.

- This smart solution uses Computer Vision and Deep Learning powered face recognition in order to identify know miscreants and bank facilitators.

- It will also display the live count of people on the premises and monitor their activities, and time and display in the dashboard which will be visible to Command Centre employees.

- This solution is named as Third Eye because all the SBI branches have an on-premise security guard and this will serve as an additional third eye to keep a check on theft and suspicious activities.
